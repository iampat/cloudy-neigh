## Sample rewrites

### Descriptive

Before:

> The WAL ensures that acknowledged writes are never lost; prior to serving
> reads, the engine replays it in order to reconstruct the memtable.

After:

> The write-ahead log (WAL) makes sure that each acknowledged write survives a
> crash. Before the engine serves reads, it replays the WAL to reconstruct the
> memtable.

### Procedural

Before:

> The benchmark suite should be run and the results compared against the
> baseline prior to merging; regressions exceeding 5% need to be investigated.

After:

> Before you merge, run the benchmark suite. Compare the results with the
> baseline. If a result is more than 5 percent slower, find the cause.

### Passive voice and "-ing" clauses

Before:

> Compaction is triggered when the segment count exceeds the threshold,
> merging smaller segments into larger ones, thereby reducing read
> amplification.

After:

> Compaction starts when the segment count is more than the threshold. It
> merges small segments into larger segments. This decreases read
> amplification.
